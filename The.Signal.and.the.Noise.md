# The Signal and the Noise: Why so many Predictions Fail - but Some Don't (Nate Silver)

Notes taken while reading, as well as some direct exercpts from the book.

## Preface
Two types of cognition:  
-System 1 - quick and instinctual
-System 2 - deliberate and conscious
(Daniel Kahneman's 2011 book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*)

The problem comes when we try to apply System 1, intuitive thinking, to complicated problems with which we have little to no experience.

- "Frankly, I don't think looking at forecasts like FiveThirtyEight's changes most people's priors much either way, since elections are an emotional crescendo, and people are deep in System 1 mode by Election Day. If you're a Democratic voter, and System 1 is telling you to be worried, then a 28.6% chance will sound pretty high. (Would you board a flight with a 28.6% chance of crashing?) Conversely, if it's telling you to relax, then Clinton's 71.4% chance might sound comforting."
